# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Launch-overhead design: three binding tiers
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every fact about a GEMM call is handled at the EARLIEST tier that can know
# it. That single rule generates the whole host-side architecture; deviations
# below are deliberate and documented so they don't get "fixed" back and forth.
#
# 1. COMPILE TIME (cute.jit trace -> tvm-ffi function, cached by @jit_cache):
#    dtypes, ranks, majors, tile/cluster config, epilogue structure — and
#    every STATIC layout relabel. The FFI signature is the caller's natural
#    tensor form; the trace rearranges it for the kernel:
#      * batch-first (l, x, y) -> (x, y, l) rotation (GemmBase.rotate_batch_last)
#      * dense rank-2 operands get a trivial (1, stride-0) batch mode appended
#      * b_kn: B crosses as (k, n[, l]) and is transposed to (n, k, l)
#      * unbatched 5-D scale factors get the batch mode prepended (SM100)
#    Rule of thumb: NEVER add a torch view (.mT/.unsqueeze/.permute) to a warm
#    path — each costs ~1-1.5us of dispatcher overhead per call. If the relabel
#    is metadata-static, do it at trace time behind a compile flag instead.
#    (Views that survive are semantic or fallbacks: swap_ab's out.mT, the
#    non-2D rank promotion, varlen's flattened forms.)
#
# 2. PLAN TIME (first call per metadata signature; immutable NamedTuple in a
#    per-entry-point dict): validation asserts, major/dtype derivation, config
#    selection (heuristic or autotuner), workspace/output recipes, static arg
#    templates, and WHICH compiled function. The plan key is built from
#    tensor_key() of every tensor argument plus every scalar knob the build
#    reads — shapes/strides subsume the majors and the validation, so a key
#    hit is exactly a replay of a previously validated call with different
#    data pointers. Scalar epilogue operands enter the key as their MODE
#    (scalar_mode: absent / host constant / device pointer) because the modes
#    select different compiled epilogues, while the VALUES stay per-call.
#
#    Plans COMPOSE BY REFERENCE: an outer layer (gemm_interface) holding a
#    resolved plan also captures the dispatch layer's plan and calls the
#    dispatch run_*_plan() directly, so a warm call pays exactly ONE key.
#    THE INVARIANT: an outer key must subsume every input of the captured
#    inner plan's key (that's why the interface key carries alpha/sr modes).
#    Two plan LAYERS are correct, not residual: they cache decisions at
#    different altitudes with different key spaces — during autotuning one
#    interface signature legitimately exercises N dispatch plans (one per
#    candidate config); collapsing the layers would re-resolve kernels on
#    every config switch.
#
# 3. CALL TIME (every call): data pointers, scalar values, stream. The warm
#    path is: one key -> dict hit -> cheap routing -> run_*_plan (epi scalars,
#    static scheduler template, FFI). ~8us of that is the FFI + cudaLaunch
#    floor; everything else is ~1-2us items.
#
# Deliberate deviations / rejected alternatives (do not revisit):
#  * The execute helper re-derives routing flags (b_kn/dense_2d/swap) per call
#    (~0.5us) instead of storing them in the plan: one routing body shared by
#    the cold and warm paths means the two can never drift. Threading flags
#    through return chains was tried on paper and costs more than it saves.
#  * Views cannot be cached (they freeze data pointers) — don't try.
#  * Per-call EpilogueArguments construction is REQUIRED (it carries pointers);
#    only an all-absent epilogue may cache a static instance (epi_static).
#  * Per-call torch.zeros/empty scratch (split-K, SM90 semaphore) is the
#    stream-correct design for free (the caching allocator is stream-aware).
#    Plan-owned scratch would need kernel self-reset protocols + per-stream
#    slabs; that is the (deferred) CUDA-graphs prerequisite, not a cleanup.
#  * An explicit zero-key handle API ("plan = gemm.plan(...); plan(...)") was
#    rejected as user-hostile; implicit metadata keys are the contract.
#
# The helpers below rely only on the common plan field names (compiled_fn,
# is_sm100_family, max_active_clusters, max_swizzle_size,
# scheduler_uses_semaphore, scheduler_static), so each entry point defines its
# own plan NamedTuple with whatever extra fields it needs.

    The inner (32, 4, 4) block has static strides (16, 4, 1) — one contiguous
    512 B atom per 128 rows x 4 K-blocks, so TMA loads it as one box. The
    kernel only consumes the base pointer and the outer (l, rm, rk) strides
    (the atom layout is hardware-fixed); outer strides are dynamic but
    atom-granular, so slices of larger scale buffers are accepted without a
    copy.

    Pass ``l=None`` for an unbatched 5-D (rm, rk, 32, 4, 4) fake (dense 2D
    operands): the kernel prepends the trivial batch mode at trace time.
